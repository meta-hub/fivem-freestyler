# fivem-freestyler
Rock a microphone.

# Installation
- Add freestyler to your resources directory either through git install or download and unzip.
- You also need to add an mp3 file (named `freestyler.mp3`) to this resources directory.
- I personally used Bomfunk MC's Freestyler (found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymNFyxvIdaM).
- Use the command `/freestyler client_id` to initiate the fun.
